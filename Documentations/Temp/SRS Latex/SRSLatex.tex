\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of this document}
Is identify the project pounders and describe functionality of project and intended audiences anyone who want to future develop our web application
\subsection{ Scope of this document}
Our customers are the pharmacies and the normal  user
\subsection{Overview}
Our project aims to guide our user to the nearest pharmacy containing medicine and to provide pharmacies with documentation about there patients and provide patients with id to provide a patient history for any pharmacy  
\subsection{ Business Context}
Advertisements
\newline
yearly subscription of pharmacies


\section{General Description}
\subsection{Product Functions}
Our project (ADwytee) helps people to reach the medicine they seek in the fastest way possible, help pharmacists to find more customers by connecting as many as pharmacies to our database server, help the customer to find the nearest pharmacy has the desired medicine and find more info about the medicine , the pharmacy ,and help pharmacies to keep track of patient history  .. etc
\subsection{Similar System Information}
Standalone project 
\subsection{ User Characteristics}
Normal people ,pharmacies and companies(normal users) developer(we will provide an API that allows the developers to create applications that it compatible with our servers for future developments)
\subsection{ User Problem Statement}
Medicine lack, high search time for medicine , the difficulty of finding alternatives for certain medicine
\subsection{ User Objectives}
Find medicine in nearest pharmacy with high precision with least effort and find possible alternatives 
\subsection{ General Constraints}
Provide easy user interface with least complexity 
provide API compatible with multiple platforms
